Solutions for Advent of Code 2022 https://adventofcode.com/2022. I've been working with Ruby last year.
I love Ruby more than Python or Perl. Its syntax is very elegant. I haven't been impressed with Go.
So much boilerplate. I think Java is probably the best language/platform for building enterprise servers.

I found out that I am very rusty. The easiest way to solve this is to collect all the values in an array list, then sort
it. This is a leaderboard-style question. The optimal way to solve this is probably using a balanced tree, but rotating
a tree is complicated. I opted for a middle-ground solution with a priority linked list.
